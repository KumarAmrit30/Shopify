Project Name: Shopify

Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Kotlin

Framework: Jetpack Compose

Project Overview:
The Shopping List App is a simple Android application that allows users to manage a shopping list. The app utilizes Jetpack Compose, which is Android's modern toolkit for building native UI, to provide a smooth and intuitive user experience.

Key Features:

•Add Items:

Users can add new items to the shopping list by clicking the "Add Item" button.
A dialog pops up to input the item name and quantity.
Users can confirm the addition or cancel the action.

•Display Items:

Items in the shopping list are displayed using a LazyColumn for efficient rendering of a potentially large list.
Each item displays the name and quantity.

•Edit Items:

Users can edit existing items by clicking the edit icon next to the item.
The selected item is displayed in an editable mode with text fields for the name and quantity.
Users can save the changes, updating the item in the list.

•Delete Items:

Users can delete items from the list by clicking the delete icon next to the item.

Code Structure:

•Data Model: The ShoppingItem data class defines the structure of a shopping item with properties for id, name, quantity, and an editing state flag.

•Main Composable Function: ShoppingListApp is the main composable function managing the state and UI of the app. It uses remember and mutableStateOf to manage the state of the shopping list, dialog visibility, and input fields.

•Item Composables:

  ShoppingListItem: Displays each item in the list with options to edit or delete.
  ShoppingItemEditor: Provides an interface for editing an item's name and quantity.
  Dialog Composables: An AlertDialog is used to add new items, with text fields for input and buttons to confirm or cancel the action.

•State Management:
The app uses Jetpack Compose's state management features to handle UI updates efficiently. mutableStateOf is used to create state variables that trigger recomposition when their values change, ensuring the UI stays in sync with the underlying data.

UI Design:
The app follows a clean and minimalistic design approach, using Compose's layout and styling components such as Column, Row, Button, OutlinedTextField, and IconButton to create an intuitive and responsive user interface.

Potential Improvements:

•Adding persistent storage (e.g., using Room or DataStore) to save the shopping list items across app restarts.

•Implementing more complex item properties, such as categories or priorities.

•Enhancing the UI with more advanced Compose features and animations.
